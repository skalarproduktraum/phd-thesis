  abstract = {We apply basic statistical reasoning to signal reconstruction by machine learning -- learning to map corrupted observations to clean signals -- with a simple and powerful conclusion: it is possible to learn to restore images by only looking at corrupted examples, at performance at and sometimes exceeding training using clean data, without explicit image priors or likelihood models of the corruption. In practice, we show that a single model learns photographic noise removal, denoising synthetic Monte Carlo images, and reconstruction of undersampled MRI scans -- all corrupted by different processes -- based on noisy data only.}

  abstract = {LIGHT SHEET MICROSCOPY IN THE MUSEUM:Light sheet microscopy (or selective plane illumination microscopy) is an important imaging technique in the life sciences. At the same time, this technique is also ideally suited for community outreach projects, because it produces visually appealing, highly dynamic images of living organisms and its working principle can be understood with basic optics knowledge. Still, the underlying concepts are widely unknown to the non-scientific public. On the occasion of the UNESCO International Year of Light, a technical museum in Dresden, Germany, launched a special, interactive exhibition. We built a fully functional, educational selective plane illumination microscope (eduSPIM) to demonstrate how developments in microscopy promote discoveries in biology. DESIGN PRINCIPLES OF AN EDUCATIONAL LIGHT SHEET MICROSCOPE:To maximize educational impact, we radically reduced a standard light sheet microscope to its essential components without compromising functionality and incorporated stringent safety concepts beyond those needed in the lab. Our eduSPIM system features one illumination and one detection path and a sealed sample chamber. We image fixed zebrafish embryos with fluorescent vasculature, because the structure is meaningful to laymen and visualises the optical principles of light sheet microscopy. Via a simplified interface, visitors acquire fluorescence and transmission data simultaneously. THE EDUSPIM DESIGN IS TAILORED EASILY TO FIT NUMEROUS APPLICATIONS:The universal concepts presented here may also apply to other scientific approaches that are communicated to laymen in interactive settings. The specific eduSPIM design is adapted easily for various outreach and teaching activities. eduSPIM may even prove useful for labs needing a simple SPIM. A detailed parts list and schematics to rebuild eduSPIM are provided.},

  abstract = {Modern fluorescence microscopy modalities, such as light-sheet microscopy, are capable of acquiring large three-dimensional images at high data rate. This creates a bottleneck in computational processing and analysis of the acquired images, as the rate of acquisition outpaces the speed of processing. Moreover, images can be so large that they do not fit the main memory of a single computer. We address both issues by developing a distributed parallel algorithm for segmentation of large fluorescence microscopy images. The method is based on the versatile Discrete Region Competition algorithm, which has previously proven useful in microscopy image segmentation. The present distributed implementation decomposes the input image into smaller sub-images that are distributed across multiple computers. Using network communication, the computers orchestrate the collectively solving of the global segmentation problem. This not only enables segmentation of large images (we test images of up to 1010 pixels), but also accelerates segmentation to match the time scale of image acquisition. Such acquisition-rate image segmentation is a prerequisite for the smart microscopes of the future and enables online data compression and interactive experiments.},

  abstract = {In the field of connectomics, neuroscientists acquire electron microscopy volumes at nanometer resolution in order to reconstruct a detailed wiring diagram of the neurons in the brain. The resulting image volumes, which often are hundreds of terabytes in size, need to be segmented to identify cell boundaries, synapses, and important cell organelles. However, the segmentation process of a single volume is very complex, time-intensive, and usually performed using a diverse set of tools and many users. To tackle the associated challenges, this paper presents NeuroBlocks, which is a novel visualization system for tracking the state, progress, and evolution of very large volumetric segmentation data in neuroscience. NeuroBlocks is a multi-user web-based application that seamlessly integrates the diverse set of tools that neuroscientists currently use for manual and semi-automatic segmentation, proofreading, visualization, and analysis. NeuroBlocks is the first system that integrates this heterogeneous tool set, providing crucial support for the management, provenance, accountability, and auditing of large-scale segmentations. We describe the design of NeuroBlocks, starting with an analysis of the domain-specific tasks, their inherent challenges, and our subsequent task abstraction and visual representation. We demonstrate the utility of our design based on two case studies that focus on different user roles and their respective requirements for performing and tracking the progress of segmentation and proofreading in a large real-world connectomics project.},

Compared to alternative immersive systems such as HMDs, CAVE systems are a powerful tool for collaborative inspection of virtual environments due to better use of peripheral vision, less sensitivity to tracking errors, and higher communication possibilities among users. Unfortunately, traditional CAVE setups require sophisticated equipment including stereo-ready projectors and tracking systems with high acquisition and maintenance costs. In this paper we present the design and construction of a passive-stereo, four-wall CAVE system based on commodity hardware. Our system works with any mix of a wide range of projector models that can be replaced independently at any time, and achieves high resolution and brightness at a minimum cost. The key ingredients of our CAVE are a self-calibration approach that guarantees continuity across the screen, as well as a gesture-based interaction approach based on a clever  combination of skeletal data from multiple Kinect sensors.}

  abstract = {We introduce a conceptual framework and an interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics and generating mechanisms of non-linear dynamical systems from partial and disordered observations based on the algorithmic contribution of each of the systems elements to the whole by exploiting principles from the theory of computability and algorithmic randomness. This calculus entails finding and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches for inferring causal relationships and formulating theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic information landscape of a system runs parallel to its dynamic landscape, affording an avenue for moving systems on one plane so they may have controlled effects on the other plane. Based on these methods, we advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access to the system's actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new approach yields a suite of powerful parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability, ranging from the discovery of causality, dimension reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness principle and a system's (re)programmability index. We apply these methods to static (e.coli Transcription Factor network) and to evolving genetic regulatory networks (differentiating naive from Th17 cells, and the CellNet database). We highlight the capability of the methods to pinpoint key elements related to cell function and cell development, conforming with biological knowledge and experimentally validated data, and demonstrate how the method can reshape a system's dynamics in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.},

This article underscores the importance of VR technology as a disruptive use case of 5G (and beyond) harnessing the latest development of storage/ memory, fog/edge computing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, and others. In particular, the main requirements of wireless interconnected VR are described followed by a selection of key enablers; then research avenues and their underlying grand challenges are presented. Furthermore, we examine three VR case studies and provide numerical results under various storage, computing, and network configurations.

This can be accomplished by making an eye movement to bring the object onto the fovea (overt attention) or by increased processing of visual information in neurons representing more peripheral regions of the visual field (covert attention). This review will examine two aspects of visual attention: the changes in neural responses within visual cortices due to the allocation of covert attention; and the neural activity in higher cortical areas involved in guiding the allocation of attention. The first section will highlight processes that occur during visual spatial attention and feature-based attention in cortical visual areas and several related models that have recently been proposed to explain this activity. The second section will focus on the parietofrontal network thought to be involved in targeting eye movements and allocating covert attention. It will describe evidence that the lateral intraparietal area, frontal eye field and superior colliculus are involved in the guidance of visual attention, and describe the priority map model, which is thought to operate in at least several of these areas.},

Rather than hide the underlying scenegraph within a toolkit-specific abstraction, D3 enables direct inspection and manipulation of a native representation: the standard document object model (DOM). With D3, designers selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements, applying dynamic transforms to both generate and modify content. We show how representational transparency improves expressiveness and better integrates with developer tools than prior approaches, while offering comparable notational efficiency and retaining powerful declarative components. Immediate evaluation of operators further simplifies debugging and allows iterative development. Additionally, we demonstrate how D3 transforms naturally enable animation and interaction with dramatic performance improvements over intermediate representations.},

We approached it in four stages: a 2-D system, a 3-D system tested with a simple task, a 6-D system tested with a simple task, and a full 6-D molecular docking system, our initial goal. This paper summarizes the entire project---the four systems, the evaluation experiments, the results, and our observations. The molecular docking system results are new.Our principal conclusions are:\&amp;bull; Haptic display as an augmentation to visual display can improve perception and understanding both of force fields and of world models populated with impenetrable objects.\&amp;bull; Whereas man-machine systems can outperform computer-only systems by orders of magnitude on some problems, haptic-augmented interactive systems seem to give about a two-fold performance improvement over purely graphical interactive systems. Better technology may give somewhat more, but a ten-fold improvement does not seem to be in the cards.\&amp;bull; Chemists using GROPE-III can readily reproduce the true docking positions for drugs whose docking is known (but not to them) and can find very good docks for drugs whose true docks are unknown. The present tool promises to yield new chemistry research results; it is being actively used by research chemists.\&amp;bull; The most valuable result from using GROPE-III for drug docking is probably the radically improved situation awareness that serious users report. Chemists say they have a new understanding of the details of the receptor site and its force fields, and of why a particular drug docks well or poorly.\&amp;bull; We see various scientific/education applications for haptic displays but believe entertainment, not scientific visualization, will drive and pace the technology.\&amp;bull; The hardware-software system technology we have used is barely adequate, and our experience sets priorities for future development.\&amp;bull; Some unexpected perceptual phenomena were observed.

This visual acuity fall-off can be used to achieve higher frame rates by adapting rendering quality to the human visual system. Volume raycasting has unique characteristics, preventing a direct transfer of many traditional foveated rendering techniques. We present an approach that utilizes the visual acuity fall-off to accelerate volume rendering based on Linde-Buzo-Gray sampling and natural neighbor interpolation. First, we measure gaze using a stationary 1200 Hz eye-tracking system. Then, we adapt our sampling and reconstruction strategy to that gaze. Finally, we apply a temporal smoothing filter to attenuate undersampling artifacts since peripheral vision is particularly sensitive to contrast changes and movement. Our approach substantially improves rendering performance with barely perceptible changes in visual quality. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through performance measurements on various data sets.}

It has been difficult to validate models of spindle assembly due to a lack of information on the organization of microtubules in these structures. Here we present a method, based on femtosecond laser ablation, capable of measuring the detailed architecture of spindles. We used this method to study the metaphase spindle in Xenopus laevis egg extracts and found that microtubules are shortest near poles and become progressively longer toward the center of the spindle. These data, in combination with mathematical modeling, imaging, and biochemical perturbations, are sufficient to reject previously proposed mechanisms of spindle assembly. Our results support a model of spindle assembly in which microtubule polymerization dynamics are not spatially regulated, and the proper organization of microtubules in the spindle is determined by nonuniform microtubule nucleation and the local sorting of microtubules by transport.},

The second compares the completion time of participants in a Tangible User Interface task with predictions by a GOMSL model and a Codein model.

Up to five live embryos were mounted and imaged simultaneously over several days using selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM). The resulting large imagery dataset of several terabytes was processed in an automated manner on a high-performance computer cluster and segmented with a novel segmentation approach that uses images of red blood cells as training data. This analysis yielded a precise quantification of growth characteristics of the whole vascular network, head vasculature, and tail vasculature over development.

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) structural information on many length scales is of central importance in biological research. Excellent methods exist to obtain structures of molecules at atomic, organelles at electron microscopic, and tissue at light-microscopic resolution. A gap exists, however, when 3D tissue structure needs to be reconstructed over hundreds of micrometers with a resolution sufficient to follow the thinnest cellular processes and to identify small organelles such as synaptic vesicles. Such 3D data are, however, essential to understand cellular networks that, particularly in the nervous system, need to be completely reconstructed throughout a substantial spatial volume. Here we demonstrate that datasets meeting these requirements can be obtained by automated block-face imaging combined with serial sectioning inside the chamber of a scanning electron microscope. Backscattering contrast is used to visualize the heavy-metal staining of tissue prepared using techniques that are routine for transmission electron microscopy. Low-vacuum (20\textendash 60 Pa H2O) conditions prevent charging of the uncoated block face. The resolution is sufficient to trace even the thinnest axons and to identify synapses. Stacks of several hundred sections, 50\textendash 70 nm thick, have been obtained at a lateral position jitter of typically under 10 nm. This opens the possibility of automatically obtaining the electron-microscope-level 3D datasets needed to completely reconstruct the connectivity of neuronal circuits.},

  year = {2019},
  doi = {10.1101/536243},
  abstract = {Eye-tracking experiments rely heavily on good data quality of eye-trackers. Unfortunately, it is often that only the spatial accuracy and precision values are available from the manufacturers. These two values alone are not sufficient enough to serve as a benchmark for an eye-tracker: Eye-tracking quality deteriorates during an experimental session due to head movements, changing illumination or calibration decay. Additionally, different experimental paradigms require the analysis of different types of eye movements, for instance smooth pursuit movements, blinks or microsaccades, which themselves cannot readily be evaluated by using spatial accuracy or precision alone. To obtain a more comprehensive description of properties, we developed an extensive eye-tracking test battery. In 10 different tasks, we evaluated eye-tracking related measures such as: the decay of accuracy, fixation durations, pupil dilation, smooth pursuit movement, microsaccade detection, blink detection, or the influence of head motion. For some measures, true theoretical values exist. For others, a relative comparison to a gold standard eye-tracker is needed. Therefore, we collected our gaze data simultaneously from a gold standard remote EyeLink\textasciitilde 1000 eye-tracker and compared it with the mobile Pupil Labs glasses. As expected, the average spatial accuracy of 0.57\textdegree{} for the EyeLink\textasciitilde 1000 eye-tracker was better than the 0.82\textdegree{} for the Pupil Labs glasses (N=15). Furthermore, we detected less fixations and shorter saccade durations for the Pupil Labs glasses. Similarly, we found fewer microsaccades using the Pupil Labs glasses. The accuracy over time decayed only slightly for the EyeLink\textasciitilde 1000, but strongly for the Pupil Labs glasses. Finally we observed that the measured pupil diameters differed between eye-trackers on the individual subject level but not the group level. To conclude, our eye-tracking test battery offers 10 tasks that allow us to benchmark the many parameters of interest in stereotypical eye-tracking situations, or addresses a common source of confounds in measurement errors (e.g. yaw and roll head movements). All recorded eye-tracking data (including Pupil Labs' eye video files), the stimulus code for the test battery and the modular analysis pipeline are available (https://github.com/behinger/etcomp).},

The purpose of this paper is to present a model based on KLM to predict performance time for doing tasks using this interface type. The required model operators were defined considering the temporal structure of hand gestures (i.e. using gesture units) and performing a systematic bibliographic review. The times for these operators were estimated by a user study consisting of various parts. Finally, the model empirical evaluation gave acceptable results (root-mean-square error = 10\%, R2 = 0.936) when compared to similar models developed for other interaction styles. Thus, the proposed model should be helpful to software designers to carry out usability assessments by predicting performance time without user participation.}

Any image that is projected through layers of randomly oriented cells will normally be distorted by refraction, reflection, and scattering. Counterintuitively, the retina of the vertebrate eye is inverted with respect to its optical function and light must pass through several tissue layers before reaching the light-detecting photoreceptor cells. Here we report on the specific optical properties of glial cells present in the retina, which might contribute to optimize this apparently unfavorable situation. We investigated intact retinal tissue and individual M\"uller cells, which are radial glial cells spanning the entire retinal thickness. M\"uller cells have an extended funnel shape, a higher refractive index than their surrounding tissue, and are oriented along the direction of light propagation. Transmission and reflection confocal microscopy of retinal tissue in vitro and in vivo showed that these cells provide a low-scattering passage for light from the retinal surface to the photoreceptor cells. Using a modified dual-beam laser trap we could also demonstrate that individual M\"uller cells act as optical fibers. Furthermore, their parallel array in the retina is reminiscent of fiberoptic plates used for low-distortion image transfer. Thus, M\"uller cells seem to mediate the image transfer through the vertebrate retina with minimal distortion and low loss. This finding elucidates a fundamental feature of the inverted retina as an optical system and ascribes a new function to glial cells.},

  doi = {10.1109/sibgrapi.2013.26},
  abstract = {View-dependent image-based rendering techniques have become increasingly popular as they combine the high quality of images with the explorability of interactive techniques. However, in the context of volume rendering, previous approaches suffer from various shortcomings, including the limitation to surfaces, expensive generation, and insufficient occlusion and motion parallax impairing depth perception. In this paper, we propose Volumetric Depth Images (VDI) to overcome these issues for view-dependent volume visualization by an extension of the Layered Depth Image (LDI) approach. Instead of only saving for each view ray of one camera configuration the depth and color values for a set of surfaces, as in LDIs, VDIs store socalled supersegments, each consisting of a depth range as well as composited color and opacity. This compact representation is independent from the structure of the original data and can be generated by slight modification of raycasters with very low overhead. VDIs can be rendered efficiently at high quality with arbitrary camera configurations by means of proxy frustum geometry and an efficient depth ordering scheme. When viewing the scene from the initial view point, VDIs produce results identical to the original raycasting. As demonstrated by means of a prototype implementation and data from different fields, our approach can be useful for preview rendering and a-priori analysis in in-situ contexts among others.},

  abstract = {This paper evaluates the degree of saliency of texts in natural scenes using visual saliency models. A large scale scene image database with pixel level ground truth is created for this purpose. Using this scene image database and five state-of-the-art models, visual saliency maps that represent the degree of saliency of the objects are calculated. The receiver operating characteristic curve is employed in order to evaluate the saliency of scene texts, which is calculated by visual saliency models. A visualization of the distribution of scene texts and non-texts in the space constructed by three kinds of saliency maps, which are calculated using Itti's visual saliency model with intensity, color and orientation features, is given. This visualization of distribution indicates that text characters are more salient than their non-text neighbors, and can be captured from the background. Therefore, scene texts can be extracted from the scene images. With this in mind, a new visual saliency architecture, named hierarchical visual saliency model, is proposed. Hierarchical visual saliency model is based on Itti's model and consists of two stages. In the first stage, Itti's model is used to calculate the saliency map, and Otsu's global thresholding algorithm is applied to extract the salient region that we are interested in. In the second stage, Itti's model is applied to the salient region to calculate the final saliency map. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms Itti's model in terms of captured scene texts.},

  abstract = {Selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM a type of light-sheet microscopy) involves focusing a thin sheet of laser light through a specimen at right angles to the objective lens. As only the thin section of the specimen at the focal plane of the lens is illuminated, out of focus light is naturally absent and toxicity due to light (phototoxicity) is greatly reduced enabling longer term live imaging. OpenSPIM is an open access platform (Pitrone et al. 2013 and OpenSPIM.org) created to give new users step-by-step instructions on building a basic configuration of a SPIM microscope, which can in principle be adapted and upgraded to each laboratory's own requirements and budget. Here we describe our own experience with the process of designing, building, configuring and using an OpenSPIM for our research into the early development of the polyclad flatworm Maritigrella crozieri \textendash{} a non-model animal. Our OpenSPIM builds on the standard design with the addition of two colour laser illumination for simultaneous detection of two probes/molecules and dual sided illumination, which provides more even signal intensity across a specimen. Our OpenSPIM provides high resolution 3d images and time lapse recordings, and we demonstrate the use of two colour lasers and the benefits of two color dual-sided imaging. We used our microscope to study the development of the embryo of the polyclad flatworm M. crozieri. The capabilities of our microscope are demonstrated by our ability to record the stereotypical spiral cleavage pattern of M. crozieri with high-speed multi-view time lapse imaging. 3D and 4D (3D + time) reconstruction of early development from these data is possible using image registration and deconvolution tools provided as part of the open source Fiji platform. We discuss our findings on the pros and cons of a self built microscope. We conclude that home-built microscopes, such as an OpenSPIM, together with the available open source software, such as MicroManager and Fiji, make SPIM accessible to anyone interested in having continuous access to their own light-sheet microscope. However, building an OpenSPIM is not without challenges and an open access microscope is a worthwhile, if significant, investment of time and money. Multi-view 4D microscopy is more challenging than we had expected. We hope that our experience gained during this project will help future OpenSPIM users with similar ambitions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Eye Gaze Tracking Systems (EGTSs) estimate the Point Of Gaze (POG) of a user. In diagnostic applications EGTSs are used to study oculomotor characteristics and abnormalities, whereas in interactive applications EGTSs are proposed as input devices for human computer interfaces (HCI), e.g. to move a cursor on the screen when mouse control is not possible, such as in the case of assistive devices for people suffering from locked-in syndrome. If the user's head remains still and the cornea rotates around its fixed centre, the pupil follows the eye in the images captured from one or more cameras, whereas the outer corneal reflection generated by an IR light source, i.e. glint, can be assumed as a fixed reference point. According to the so-called pupil centre corneal reflection method (PCCR), the POG can be thus estimated from the pupil-glint vector. METHODS:A new model-independent EGTS based on the PCCR is proposed. The mapping function based on artificial neural networks allows to avoid any specific model assumption and approximation either for the user's eye physiology or for the system initial setup admitting a free geometry positioning for the user and the system components. The robustness of the proposed EGTS is proven by assessing its accuracy when tested on real data coming from: i) different healthy users; ii) different geometric settings of the camera and the light sources; iii) different protocols based on the observation of points on a calibration grid and halfway points of a test grid. RESULTS:The achieved accuracy is approximately 0.49\textdegree, 0.41\textdegree, and 0.62\textdegree{} for respectively the horizontal, vertical and radial error of the POG. CONCLUSIONS:The results prove the validity of the proposed approach as the proposed system performs better than EGTSs designed for HCI which, even if equipped with superior hardware, show accuracy values in the range 0.6\textdegree -1\textdegree.},

Rather than producing a static build of a C application, TruffleC is a self-optimizing abstract syntax tree (AST) interpreter combined with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. Our self-optimizing interpreter specializes the AST based on run-time feedback. AST specialization relies on optimistic assumptions and allows us to build inline caches for polymorphic function pointer calls, to profile runtime values and to potentially replace them with constants, or to speculatively remove code that was not executed yet. After AST specialization, the JIT compiler translates the AST to highly optimized machine code. The machine code uses dynamic deoptimization points at which the control switches back to the interpreter in case of a violated assumption. We evaluated TruffleC using a C micro-benchmark in terms of peak performance. This evaluation showed that TruffleC outperforms the code produced by industry standard compilers such as GCC or Clang/LLVM. The evaluation of other benchmarks ("Computer Language Benchmarks Game") showed that the TruffleC performance is on average only 7\% slower than the best performance out of the GCC and Clang/LLVM performances.}

  abstract = {Visualization applications nowadays not only face increasingly larger datasets, but have to solve increasingly complex research questions. They often require more than a single algorithm and consequently a software solution will exceed the possibilities of simple research prototypes. Well-established systems intended for such complex visual analysis purposes have usually been designed for classical, mesh-based graphics approaches. For particle-based data, however, existing visualization frameworks are too generic - e.g. lacking possibilities for consistent low-level GPU optimization for high-performance graphics - and at the same time are too limited - e.g. by enforcing the use of structures suboptimal for some computations. Thus, we developed the system softwareMegaMol for visualization research on particle-based data. On the one hand, flexible data structures and functional module design allow for easy adaption to changing research questions, e.g. studying vapors in thermodynamics, solid material in physics, or complex functional macromolecules like proteins in biochemistry. Therefore, MegaMol is designed as a development framework. On the other hand, common functionality for data handling and advanced rendering implementations are available and beneficial for all applications. We present several case studies of work implemented using our system as well as a comparison to other freely available or open source systems.},

  abstract = {Particle-based simulations are a popular tool for researchers in various sciences. In combination with the availability of ever larger COTS clusters and the consequently increasing number of simulated particles the resulting datasets pose a challenge for real-time visualization. Additionally the semantic density of the particles exceeds the possibilities of basic glyphs, like splats or spheres and results in dataset sizes larger by at least an order of magnitude. Interactive visualization on common workstations requires a careful optimization of the data management, especially of the transfer between CPU and GPU. We propose a flexible benchmarking tool along with a series of tests to allow the evaluation of the performance of different CPU/GPU combinations in relation to a particular implementation. We evaluate different uploading strategies and rendering methods for point-based compound glyphs suitable for representing the aforementioned datasets. CPU and GPU-based approaches are compared with respect to their rendering and storage efficiency to point out the optimal solution when dealing with time-dependent datasets. The results of our research are of general interest since they can be transferred to other applications where CPU-GPU bandwidth and a high number of graphical primitives per dataset pose a problem. The employed tool set for streamlining the measurement process is made publicly available.}

  abstract = {Life science today involves computational analysis of a large amount and variety of data, such as volumetric data acquired by state-of-the-art microscopes, or mesh data from analysis of such data or simulations. Visualization is often the first step in making sense of data, and a crucial part of building and debugging analysis pipelines. It is therefore important that visualizations can be quickly prototyped, as well as developed or embedded into full applications. In order to better judge spatiotemporal relationships, immersive hardware, such as Virtual or Augmented Reality (VR/AR) headsets and associated controllers are becoming invaluable tools. In this work we introduce scenery, a flexible VR/AR visualization framework for the Java VM that can handle mesh and large volumetric data, containing multiple views, timepoints, and color channels. scenery is free and open-source software, works on all major platforms, and uses the Vulkan or OpenGL rendering APIs. We introduce scenery's main features and example applications, such as its use in VR for microscopy, in the biomedical image analysis software Fiji, or for visualizing agent-based simulations.},

Here we show that when people judge the mechanical forces acting on an object, their judgments are biased by another person gazing at the object. The bias is consistent with an implicit perception that gaze adds a gentle force, pushing on the object. The bias was present even though the participants were not explicitly aware of it and claimed that they did not believe in an extramission view of vision (a common folk view of vision in which the eyes emit an invisible energy). A similar result was not obtained on control trials when participants saw a blindfolded face turned toward the object, or a face with open eyes turned away from the object. The findings suggest that people automatically and implicitly generate a model of other people's vision that uses the simplifying construct of beams coming out of the eyes. This implicit model of active gaze may be a hidden, yet fundamental, part of the rich process of social cognition, contributing to how we perceive visual agency. It may also help explain the extraordinary cultural persistence of the extramission myth of vision.},

  abstract = {Programs evolved by genetic programming unfortunately often do not generalize to unseen data. Reliable synthesis of programs that generalize to unseen data is therefore an important open problem. We present evidence that smaller programs evolved using the PushGP system tend to generalize better over a range of program synthesis problems. Like in many genetic programming systems, programs evolved by PushGP usually have pieces that can be removed without changing the behavior of the program. We describe methods for automatically simplifying evolved programs to make them smaller and potentially improve their generalization. We present five simplification methods and analyze their strengths and weaknesses on a suite of general program synthesis benchmark problems. All of our methods use a straightforward hill-climbing procedure to remove pieces of a program while ensuring that the resulting program gives the same errors on the training data as did the original program. We show that automatic simplification, previously used both for post-run analysis and as a genetic operator, can significantly improve the generalization rates of evolved programs.}

  abstract = {Natural selection explains how life has evolved over millions of years from more primitive forms. The speed at which this happens, however, has sometimes defied formal explanations when based on random (uniformly distributed) mutations. Here, we investigate the application of a simplicity bias based on a natural but algorithmic distribution of mutations (no recombination) in various examples, particularly binary matrices, in order to compare evolutionary convergence rates. Results both on synthetic and on small biological examples indicate an accelerated rate when mutations are not statistically uniform but algorithmically uniform. We show that algorithmic distributions can evolve modularity and genetic memory by preservation of structures when they first occur sometimes leading to an accelerated production of diversity but also to population extinctions, possibly explaining naturally occurring phenomena such as diversity explosions (e.g. the Cambrian) and massive extinctions (e.g. the End Triassic) whose causes are currently a cause for debate. The natural approach introduced here appears to be a better approximation to biological evolution than models based exclusively upon random uniform mutations, and it also approaches a formal version of open-ended evolution based on previous formal results. These results validate some suggestions in the direction that computation may be an equally important driver of evolution. We also show that inducing the method on problems of optimization, such as genetic algorithms, has the potential to accelerate convergence of artificial evolutionary algorithms.},

This paper presents a detailed analysis of six functions for measuring distance between 3D rotations that have been proposed in the literature. Based on the well-developed theory behind 3D rotations, we demonstrate that five of them are bi-invariant metrics on SO(3) but that only four of them are boundedly equivalent to each other. We conclude that it is both spatially and computationally more efficient to use quaternions for 3D rotations. Lastly, by treating the two rotations as a true and an estimated rotation matrix, we illustrate the geometry associated with iso-error measures.},

  abstract = {Rendering techniques that increase realism in volume visualization help enhance perception of the 3D features in the volume data. While techniques focusing on high-quality global illumination have been extensively studied, few works handle the interaction of light with materials in the volume. Existing techniques for light-material interaction are limited in their ability to handle high-frequency real-world material data, and the current treatment of volume data poorly supports the correct integration of surface materials. In this paper, we introduce an alternative definition for the transfer function which supports surface-like behavior at the boundaries between volume components and volume-like behavior within. We show that this definition enables multi-material rendering with high-quality, real-world material data. We also show that this approach offers an efficient alternative to pre-integrated rendering through isosurface techniques. We introduce arbitrary spatially-varying materials to achieve better multi-material support for scanned volume data. Finally, we show that it is possible to map an arbitrary set of parameters directly to a material representation for the more intuitive creation of novel materials.},

First, the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context. Second, a unique 'saliency map' that topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third, inhibition of return, the process by which the currently attended location is prevented from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment. Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention. And last, scene understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended locations. Insights from these five key areas provide a framework for a computational and neurobiological understanding of visual attention.},

However, the advent of consumer grade virtual reality (VR) headsets such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive means it is now possible to visualize and interact with scientific data in a 3D virtual world. In addition, new microscopic methods provide an unprecedented opportunity to obtain new 3D data sets. In this perspective article, we highlight how we have used cutting edge imaging techniques to build a 3D virtual model of a cell from serial block-face scanning electron microscope (SBEM) imaging data. This model allows scientists, students and members of the public to explore and interact with a ``real'' cell. Early testing of this immersive environment indicates a significant improvement in students' understanding of cellular processes and points to a new future of learning and public engagement.

Frequently, such systems utilize levels of abstraction to improve the application development process, for instance by providing a data flow network editor. Unfortunately, these abstractions result in several issues, which need to be circumvented through an abstraction-centered system design. Often, a high level of abstraction hides low level details, which makes it difficult to directly access the underlying computing platform, which would be important to achieve an optimal performance. Therefore, we propose a layer structure developed for modern and sustainable visualization systems allowing developers to interact with all contained abstraction levels. We refer to this interaction capabilities as usage abstraction levels, since we target application developers with various levels of experience. We formulate the requirements for such a system, derive the desired architecture, and present how the concepts have been exemplary realized within the Inviwo visualization system. Furthermore, we address several specific challenges that arise during the realization of such a layered architecture, such as communication between different computing platforms, performance centered encapsulation, as well as layer-independent development by supporting cross layer documentation and debugging capabilities.},

Based on the existing evidence, at least 3 large-scale brain networks are involved simultaneously when one is submitted to a creativity-related task. The question whether the key brain regions involved in visual art creativity can be identified and receive neuromodulation to get empowered prompted us to perform the present case investigation. Virtual reality and functional quantitative electroencephalography upon 2- vs 3-dimentional painting were employed to study cortical neurodynamics in a professional painting artist.}

  abstract = {This paper introduces information-theoretic measure of complexity (ICOMP) criterion for model selection in multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) to tradeoff efficiently between how well the model fits the data and the model complexity. As is well known, MARS is a popular nonparametric regression technique used to study the nonlinear relationship between a response variable and the set of predictors with the help of piecewise linear or cubic splines as basis functions. A critical aspect in determining the form of the nonparametric regression model during the MARS strategy is the evaluation of portfolio of submodels to select the best submodel with the appropriate number of knots over subset of predictors. In the usual regression modeling, when a large number of predictor variables are present in the model, and there is no precise information about the exact functional relationships among the variables, many model selection criteria still overfit the model. In this paper, to find the simplest model that balances the overfitting and underfitting for the model, ICOMP is proposed as a powerful model selection criterion for MARS modeling. Here, the model complexity is treated with respect to the interdependency of parameter estimates, as well as the number of free parameters in the model. We develop and study the performance of ICOMP along with several most popular model selection criteria such as Akaike's information criterion, Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion and generalized cross-validation in MARS modeling to select the best subset models. We provide two Monte Carlo simulation examples and a real benchmark example to demonstrate the utility and versatility of the proposed model selection approach to determine best functional form of the predictive model. Our numerical examples show that ICOMP provides a general model selection criterion with an insight to the interdependencies and/or correlational structure between parameter estimates in the selected model. This new approach can also be applicable to many complex statistical modeling problems.},

  abstract = {Simulator sickness (SS) in high-fidelity visual simulators is a byproduct of modem simulation technology. Although it involves symptoms similar to those of motion-induced sickness (MS), SS tends to be less severe, to be of lower incidence, and to originate from elements of visual display and visuo-vestibular interaction atypical of conditions that induce MS. Most studies of SS to date index severity with some variant of the Pensacola Motion Sickness Questionnaire (MSQ). The MSQ has several deficiencies as an instrument for measuring SS. Some symptoms included in the scoring of MS are irrelevant for SS, and several are misleading. Also, the configural approach of the MSQ is not readily adaptable to computer administration and scoring. This article describes the development of a Simulator Sickness Questiomaire (SSQ), derived from the MSQ using a series of factor analyses, and illustrates its use in monitoring simulator performance with data from a computerized SSQ survey of 3,691 simulator hops. The database used for development included more than 1,100 MSQs, representing data from 10 Navy simulators. The SSQ provides straightforward computer or manual scoring, increased power to identify "problem" simulators, and improved diagnostic capability.},

  abstract = {Objective: Motion sickness (MS) can be a debilitating side effect associated with motion in real or virtual environments. We analyzed the effect of expectancy on MS and propose and validate a fast and simple MS measure. Background: Several questionnaires measure MS before or after stimulus presentation, but no satisfactory tool has been established to quickly capture MS data during exposure. To fill this gap, we introduce the Fast MS Scale (FMS), a verbal rating scale ranging from zero (no sickness at all) to 20 (frank sickness). Also, little is known about the role of expectancy effects in MS studies. We conducted an experiment that addressed this issue. Method: For this study, 126 volunteers participated in two experiments. During stimulus presentation, participants had to verbally rate the severity of MS every minute before filling in the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ). To measure expectancy effects, participants were separated into three groups with either positive, negative, or neutral expectations. Results: We compared the verbal ratings with the SSQ scores. Pearson correlations were high for both the SSQ total score (r = .785) and the nausea subscore (r = .828). No expectancy effects were found. Conclusion: The FMS is a fast and valid method to obtain MS data. It offers the possibility to record MS during stimulus presentation and to capture its time course. We found expectancy not to play a crucial role in MS. However, the FMS has some limitations. Application: The FMS offers improved MS measurement. It is fast and efficient and can be performed online in environments such as virtual reality.},

Electrical micro-stimulation of the SC in two head-free (non-immobilized) monkeys evoked natural-looking, eye-head gaze shifts, with anterior sites producing small, fixed-vector movements and posterior sites producing larger, strongly converging movements. However, when correctly calculated in retinal coordinates, all of these trajectories became 'fixed-vector.' Moreover, our data show that this eye-centered SC command is then further transformed, as a function of eye and head position, by downstream mechanisms into the head- and body-centered commands for coordinated eye-head gaze shifts.},

Direct volume rendering of radial basis function (RBF) kernels in domain-space offers flexible classification and robust feature reconstruction, but achieving performant RBF volume rendering remains a challenge for existing methods on both CPUs and accelerators. In this paper, we present a fast CPU method for direct volume rendering of particle data with RBF kernels. We propose a novel two-pass algorithm: first sampling the RBF field using coherent bounding hierarchy traversal, then subsequently integrating samples along ray segments. Our approach performs interactively for a range of data sets from molecular dynamics and astrophysics up to 82 million particles. It does not rely on level of detail or subsampling, and offers better reconstruction quality than structured volume rendering of the same data, exhibiting comparable performance and requiring no additional preprocessing or memory footprint other than the BVH. Lastly, our technique enables multi-field, multi-material classification of particle data, providing better insight and analysis.},

Existing approaches such as questionnaires or pupil dilation measurements either only allow for subjective assessments or are susceptible to environmental influences and user physiology. We address these challenges by exploiting the fact that cognitive workload influences smooth pursuit eye movements. We compared three trajectories and two speeds under different levels of cognitive workload within a user study (N=20). We found higher deviations of gaze points during smooth pursuit eye movements for specific trajectory types at higher cognitive workload levels. Using an SVM classifier, we predict cognitive workload through smooth pursuit with an accuracy of 99.5\% for distinguishing between low and high workload as well as an accuracy of 88.1\% for estimating workload between three levels of difficulty. We discuss implications and present use cases of how cognition-aware systems benefit from inferring cognitive workload in real-time by smooth pursuit eye movements.},

The knowledge about the function of this structure is mainly based on single-unit recordings in animals with relatively few neuroimaging studies investigating eye-movement related brain activity in humans. The present study employed high-field (7 Tesla) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate SC responses during endogenously cued saccades in humans. In response to centrally presented instructional cues, subjects either performed saccades away from (centrifugal) or towards (centripetal) the center of straight gaze or maintained fixation at the center position. Compared to central fixation, the execution of saccades elicited hemodynamic activity within a network of cortical and subcortical areas that included the SC, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), occipital cortex, striatum, and the pulvinar. Activity in the SC was enhanced contralateral to the direction of the saccade (i.e., greater activity in the right as compared to left SC during leftward saccades and vice versa) during both centrifugal and centripetal saccades, thereby demonstrating that the contralateral predominance for saccade execution that has been shown to exist in animals is also present in the human SC. In addition, centrifugal saccades elicited greater activity in the SC than did centripetal saccades, while also being accompanied by an enhanced deactivation within the prefrontal default-mode network. This pattern of brain activity might reflect the reduced processing effort required to move the eyes toward as compared to away from the center of straight gaze, a position that might serve as a spatial baseline in which the retinotopic and craniotopic reference frames are aligned.},

  abstract = {The field of volume visualization has undergone rapid development during the past years, both due to advances in suitable computing hardware and due to the increasing availability of large volume datasets. Recent work has focused on increasing the visual realism in Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) by integrating a number of visually plausible but often effect-specific rendering techniques, for instance modeling of light occlusion and depth of field. Besides yielding more attractive renderings, especially the more realistic lighting has a positive effect on perceptual tasks. Although these new rendering techniques yield impressive results, they exhibit limitations in terms of their exibility and their performance. Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT), coupled with physically based light transport, is the de-facto standard for synthesizing highly realistic images in the graphics domain, although usually not from volumetric data. Due to the stochastic sampling of MCRT algorithms, numerous effects can be achieved in a relatively straight-forward fashion. For this reason, we have developed a practical framework that applies MCRT techniques also to direct volume rendering (DVR). With this work, we demonstrate that a host of realistic effects, including physically based lighting, can be simulated in a generic and flexible fashion, leading to interactive DVR with improved realism. In the hope that this improved approach to DVR will see more use in practice, we have made available our framework under a permissive open source license.},

We found that pulling forces exerted by daughter cells on the intercellular bridge appear to regulate abscission. Counterintuitively, these forces prolonged connection, whereas a release of tension induced abscission. Tension release triggered the assembly of ESCRT-III (endosomal sorting complex required for transport\textendash III), which was followed by membrane fission.

We conducted a controlled experiment in which we studied the independent and combined effects of three components of immersion (head tracking, field of regard, and stereoscopic rendering) on the effectiveness of visualization tasks with two x-ray microscopic computed tomography datasets. We report significant benefits of analyzing volume data in an environment involving those components of immersion. We find that the benefits do not necessarily require all three components simultaneously, and that the components have variable influence on different task categories. The results of our study improve our understanding of the effects of immersion on perceived and actual task performance, and provide guidance on the choice of display systems to designers seeking to maximize the effectiveness of volume visualization applications.},

  abstract = {Virtual reality for stroke rehabilitation Review question We wanted to compare the effects of virtual reality versus an alternative treatment or no treatment on recovery after stroke using arm function and other outcomes such as walking speed and independence in managing daily activities after stroke. Background Many people after having a stroke have difficulty moving, thinking, and sensing. This often results in problems with everyday activities such as writing, walking, and driving. Virtual reality and interactive video gaming are types of therapy being provided to people after having a stroke. The therapy involves using computer-based programs designed to simulate real life objects and events. Virtual reality and interactive video gaming may have some advantages over traditional therapy approaches as they can give people an opportunity to practise everyday activities that are not or cannot be practised within the hospital environment. Furthermore, there are several features of virtual reality programs that might mean that patients spend more time in therapy: for example, the activity might be more motivating. Study characteristics We identified 72 studies involving 2470 people after stroke. A wide range of virtual reality programs were used, with most aimed to improve either arm function or walking ability. The evidence is current to April 2017. Key results Twenty-two trials tested whether the use of virtual reality compared with conventional therapy resulted in an improved ability to use one's arm and found that the use of virtual reality did not result in better function (low-quality evidence). When virtual reality was used in addition to usual care or rehabilitation to increase the amount of time the person spent in therapy there were improvements in the functioning of the arm (low-quality evidence). Six trials tested whether the use of virtual reality compared with conventional therapy resulted in improved walking speed. There was no evidence that virtual reality was more effective in this case (low-quality evidence). Ten trials found that there was some evidence that virtual reality resulted in a slightly better ability to manage everyday activities such as showering and dressing (moderate-quality evidence). However, these positive effects were found soon after the end of the treatment and it is not clear whether the effects are long lasting. Results should be interpreted with caution as, while there are a large number of studies, the studies are generally small and not of high quality. A small number of people using virtual reality reported pain, headaches, or dizziness. No serious adverse events were reported. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was generally of low or moderate quality. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was limited due to small numbers of study participants, inconsistent results across studies, and poor reporting of study details.},

This paper describes how visual object representations can be learned and improved by performing object manipulation actions, such as, poke, push and pick-up with a humanoid robot.

In this paper, we explore methods for encorporating gaze direction into rendering algorithms. This approach permits generation of images exhibiting continuously varying resolution, and allows these images to be displayed on conventional television monitors. Specifically, we describe a ray tracer for volume data in which the number of rays cast per unit area on the image plane and the number of samples drawn per unit length along each ray are functions of local retinal acuity. We also describe an implementation using 2D and 3D mip maps, an eye tracker, and the Pixel-Planes 5 massively parallel raster display system. Pending completion of Pixel-Planes 5 in the spring of 1990, we have written a simulator on a Stellar graphics supercomputer. Preliminary results indicate that while users are aware of the variable-resolution structure of the image, the high-resolution sweet spot follows their gaze well and promises to be useful in practice.},

To develop these tools we demonstrated that two light-activated signaling proteins, vertebrate rat rhodopsin 4 (RO4) and the green algae channelrhodospin 2 (ChR2), could be used to control neuronal excitability and modulate synaptic transmission. Vertebrate rhodopsin couples to the Gi/o, pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway to allow modulation of G protein-gated inward rectifying potassium channels and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Light-mediated activation of RO4 in cultured hippocampal neurons reduces neuronal firing within ms by hyperpolarization of the somato-dendritic membrane and when activated at presynaptic sites modulates synaptic transmission and paired-pulse facilitation. In contrast, somato-dendritic activation of ChR2 depolarizes neurons sufficiently to induce immediate action potentials, which precisely follow the ChR2 activation up to light stimulation frequencies of 20 Hz. To demonstrate that these constructs are useful for regulating network behavior in intact organisms, embryonic chick spinal cords were electroporated with either construct, allowing the frequency of episodes of spontaneous bursting activity, known to be important for motor circuit formation, to be precisely controlled. Thus light-activated vertebrate RO4 and green algae ChR2 allow the antagonistic control of neuronal function within ms to s in a precise, reversible, and noninvasive manner in cultured neurons and intact vertebrate spinal cords.},

Here, we show that the C. elegans interneuron AIY regulates two distinct behavioral outputs: locomotion speed and direction-switch by recruiting~two different circuits. The ``speed'' circuit is excitatory with a wide dynamic range, which is well suited to encode speed, an analog-like output. The~``direction-switch'' circuit is inhibitory with a narrow dynamic range, which is ideal for encoding direction-switch, a digital-like output. Both circuits~employ the neurotransmitter ACh but utilize distinct~postsynaptic ACh receptors, whose distinct biophysical properties contribute to the distinct dynamic ranges of the two circuits. This mechanism enables graded C.~elegans synapses to encode both analog- and digital-like outputs. Our studies illustrate how an interneuron in a simple organism encodes multiple behavioral outputs at the circuit, synaptic, and molecular levels.},

Trunk NC cells migrate as individuals with~both stochastic and biased features as they move~dorsoventrally to form peripheral ganglia. Their leading edge displays a prominent fan-shaped lamellipodium that reorients upon cell-cell contact. Computational analysis reveals that when the lamellipodium of one cell touches the body of another, the two cells undergo ``contact attraction,'' often moving together and then separating via a pulling force exerted by lamellipodium. Targeted optical manipulation shows that cell interactions coupled with cell density generate a long-range biased random walk behavior, such that cells move from high to low density. In contrast to chain migration noted at other axial levels, the results show that individual trunk NC cells navigate the complex environment without tight coordination between neighbors.},

The steering law is formulated as a continuous goal-crossing task, in which a large number of goals are crossed along the path. The steering law has been verified empirically for locomotion, in which a virtual driving task through straight and circular paths was performed.We revisit the path steering law for manipulation tasks in desktop virtual environments. We have conducted controlled experiments in which users operated a pen input device to steer a virtual ball through paths of varying length, width, curvature and orientation. Our results indicate that, although the steering law provides a good description of the overall task time as a function of index of difficulty ID=L/W, where L and W are the path length and width, it does not account for other relevant factors. We specifically show that the influence of curvature can be modeled by a percentage increase in steering time, independent of index of difficulty. The path orientation relative to the viewing direction has a periodic effect on the steering time, which can be optimally described by a function of Fourier series expansions. In addition, there is also an effect of the handedness of the subjects on the steering between the left and right districts in 3D manipulation tasks.},

We developed the first gaze speller explicitly utilizing smooth pursuit eye movements and their particular characteristics. The speller achieves sufficient accuracy with a one-point calibration and does not require extensive training. Its interface consists of character elements which move apart from each other in two stages. As each element has a unique track, gaze following this track can be detected by an algorithm that does not rely on the exact gaze coordinates and compensates latency-based artefacts. In a user study, 24 participants tested four speed-levels of moving elements to determine an optimal interaction speed. At 300 px/s users showed highest overall performance of 3.34 WPM (without training). Subjective ratings support the finding that this pace is superior.},

We found that the Dachsous/Fat/Four-jointed (Ds/Ft/Fj) pathway is key for their alignment. The refinement of the tissue-wide expression of the atypical cadherins Ds and Ft result in their polarization and directional adhesiveness. Mechanistically, the axially oriented changes in histoblasts respond to the redesign of the epithelial field. We suggest that the role of Ds/Ft/Fj in long-range oriented cell alignment is a general function and that the regulation of the expression of its components will be crucial in other morphogenetic models or during tissue repair.},

Without the need to communicate with other processing units, each subvolume is ray traced locally and generates a partial image. The parallel compositing process then merges all resulting partial images in depth order to produce the complete image. The compositing algorithm is particularly effective for massively parallel processing, as it always uses all processing units by repeatedly subdividing the partial images and distributing them to the appropriate processing units. Test results on both the CM-5 and the workstations are promising. They do, however, expose different performance issues for each platform.\&lt;\&gt;},

The GUI was designed to include a portable and low-cost eye-tracker and a soft-switch wherein the wheelchair can be controlled in three different ways: 1) with a touchpad 2) with an eye-tracker only, and 3) eye-tracker with soft-switch. The interface includes nine different commands (eight directions and stop) and integrated within a powered wheelchair system. We evaluated the performance of the multimodal interface in terms of lap-completion time, the number of commands, and the information transfer rate (ITR) with eight healthy participants. The analysis of the results showed that the eye-tracker with soft-switch provides superior performance with an ITR of 37.77 bits/min among the three different conditions (p\&lt;;0.05). Thus, the proposed system provides an effective and economical solution to the Midas-Touch problem and extended usability for the large population of disabled users.},

Augmented reality (AR) neuronavigation is a significant advance, providing a real-time updated 3D virtual model of anatomical details, overlaid on the real surgical field. Currently, only a few AR systems have been tested in a clinical setting. The aim is to review such devices. We performed a PubMed search of reports restricted to human studies of in vivo applications of AR in any neurosurgical procedure using the search terms ``Augmented reality'' and ``Neurosurgery.'' Eligibility assessment was performed independently by two reviewers in an unblinded standardized manner. The systems were qualitatively evaluated on the basis of the following: neurosurgical subspecialty of application, pathology of treated lesions and lesion locations, real data source, virtual data source, tracking modality, registration technique, visualization processing, display type, and perception location. Eighteen studies were included during the period 1996 to September 30, 2015. The AR systems were grouped by the real data source: microscope (8), hand- or head-held cameras (4), direct patient view (2), endoscope (1), and X-ray fluoroscopy (1) head-mounted display (1). A total of 195 lesions were treated: 75 (38.46~\%) were neoplastic, 77 (39.48~\%) neurovascular, and 1 (0.51~\%) hydrocephalus, and 42 (21.53~\%) were undetermined. Current literature confirms that AR is a reliable and versatile tool when performing minimally invasive approaches in a wide range of neurosurgical diseases, although prospective randomized studies are not yet available and technical improvements are needed.},

  abstract = {Mechanochemical processes in thin biological structures, such as the cellular cortex or epithelial sheets, play a key role during the morphogenesis of cells and tissues. In particular, they are responsible for the dynamical organization of active stresses that lead to flows and deformations of the material. Consequently, advective transport redistributes force-generating molecules and thereby contributes to a complex mechanochemical feedback loop. It has been shown in fixed geometries that this mechanism enables patterning, but the interplay of these processes with shape changes of the material remains to be explored. In this work, we study the fully self-organized shape dynamics using the theory of active fluids on deforming surfaces and develop a numerical approach to solve the corresponding force and torque balance equations. We describe the spontaneous generation of nontrivial surface shapes, shape oscillations, and directed surface flows that resemble peristaltic waves from self-organized, mechanochemical processes on the deforming surface. Our approach provides opportunities to explore the dynamics of self-organized active surfaces and can help to understand the role of shape as an integral element of the mechanochemical organization of morphogenetic processes.},

Discoveries and concepts in biology are typically summarized with illustrations assembled manually from the interpretation and application of heterogenous data. The creation of such illustrations is time consuming, which makes it incompatible with frequent updates to the measured data as new discoveries are made. Illustrations are typically non-interactive, and when an illustration is updated, it still has to reach the user. Our system is designed to overcome these three obstacles. It supports the integration of heterogeneous datasets, reflecting the knowledge that is gained from different data sources in biology. After pre-processing the datasets, the system transforms them into visual representations as inspired by scientific illustrations. As opposed to traditional scientific illustration these representations are generated in real-time - they are interactive. The code generating the visualizations can be embedded in various software environments. To demonstrate this, we implemented both a desktop application and a remote-rendering server in which the pipeline is embedded. The remote-rendering server supports multi-threaded rendering and it is able to handle multiple users simultaneously. This scalability to different hardware environments, including multi-GPU setups, makes our system useful for efficient public dissemination of biological discoveries.},

Our system, using a head-mounted display (HMD), includes all of the standard VC features, such as the volume rendered endoluminal fly-through, measurement tool, bookmark modes, electronic biopsy, and slice views. The use of VR immersion, stereo, and wider field of view and field of regard has a positive effect on polyp search and analysis tasks in our immersive VC system, a volumetric-based immersive analytics application. Navigation includes enhanced automatic speed and direction controls, based on the user's head orientation, in conjunction with physical navigation for exploration of local proximity. In order to accommodate the resolution and frame rate requirements for HMDs, new rendering techniques have been developed, including mesh-assisted volume raycasting and a novel lighting paradigm. Feedback and further suggestions from expert radiologists show the promise of our system for immersive analysis for VC and encourage new avenues for exploring the use of VR in visualization systems for medical diagnosis.},

The spatiotemporal organization of cells and organisms, however, also depends on physical processes such as diffusion or cytoplasmic flows, and strategies to perturb physical transport inside cells are not yet available. Here, we demonstrate focused-light-induced cytoplasmic streaming (FLUCS). FLUCS is local, directional, dynamic, probe-free, physiological, and is even applicable through rigid egg shells or cell walls. We explain FLUCS via time-dependent modelling of thermoviscous flows. Using FLUCS, we demonstrate that cytoplasmic flows drive partitioning-defective protein (PAR) polarization in Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, and that cortical flows are sufficient to transport PAR domains and invert PAR polarity. In addition, we find that asymmetric cell division is a binary decision based on gradually varying PAR polarization states. Furthermore, the use of FLUCS for active microrheology revealed a metabolically induced fluid-to-solid transition of the yeast cytoplasm. Our findings establish how a wide range of transport-dependent models of cellular organization become testable by FLUCS. Mittasch et al. show that controlling cytoplasmic flow via focused-light-induced cytoplasmic streaming (FLUCS), a non-invasive technique, can be used to invert asymmetric cell division in Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes.},

As expected, the duration of these three-dimensional movements was rather variable and affected markedly by direction to target. As a result, the variance in the movement times produced was not satisfactorily explained by the conventional Fitts' model. The conventional model was extended by incorporating a directional parameter into the model. The extended model was shown to better fit the data than the conventional Fitts' model, both in terms of r2 and the standard error of the residual between the measured movement time and the value predicted by model fit.},

This includes not only improvements for local rendering like WebGL and HTML5, but also infrastructures like grid or cloud computing platforms. Another important factor is the transfer of data between the server and the client. Therefore, we also discuss advances in this field, for example methods to reduce bandwidth requirements like compression and other optimizations such as progressive rendering and streaming. After establishing these technical foundations, we review existing web-based visualization applications and prototypes from various application domains. Furthermore, we propose a classification of these web-based applications based on the technologies and algorithms they employ. Finally, we also discuss promising application areas that would benefit from web-based visualization and assess their feasibility based on the existing approaches.},

[CPP*05]; we review publications accumulated since its publication over a decade ago, and include earlier methods that are key for building light transport paths in a stochastic manner. We begin by describing analog and non-analog procedures for free-path sampling and discuss various expected-value, collision, and track-length estimators for computing transmittance. We then review the various rendering algorithms that employ these as building blocks for path sampling. Special attention is devoted to null-collision methods that utilize fictitious matter to handle spatially varying densities; we import two ``next-flight'' estimators originally developed in nuclear sciences. Whenever possible, we draw connections between image-synthesis techniques and methods from particle physics and neutron transport to provide the reader with a broader context.},

This framework should accelerate progress in nanoscale molecular engineering areas including conformational mapping, drug development, synthetic biology, and catalyst design.

We demonstrate that CID islands represent functional ectopic kinetochores, which are non-randomly distributed on the chromosome and show a preferential localization near telomeres and pericentric heterochromatin in transcriptionally silent, intergenic chromatin domains. Although overexpression of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) or increasing histone acetylation interferes with CID island formation on a global scale, induction of a locally defined region of synthetic heterochromatin by targeting HP1\textendash LacI fusions to stably integrated Lac operator arrays produces a proximal hotspot for CID deposition.

To study and improve potential gains, we designed a foveated rendering user study to evaluate the perceptual abilities of human peripheral vision when viewing today's displays. We determined that filtering peripheral regions reduces contrast, inducing a sense of tunnel vision. When applying a postprocess contrast enhancement, subjects tolerated up to 2\texttimes{} larger blur radius before detecting differences from a non-foveated ground truth. After verifying these insights on both desktop and head mounted displays augmented with high-speed gaze-tracking, we designed a perceptual target image to strive for when engineering a production foveated renderer. Given our perceptual target, we designed a practical foveated rendering system that reduces number of shades by up to 70\% and allows coarsened shading up to 30\textdegree{} closer to the fovea than Guenter et al. [2012] without introducing perceivable aliasing or blur. We filter both pre- and post-shading to address aliasing from undersampling in the periphery, introduce a novel multiresolution- and saccade-aware temporal antialising algorithm, and use contrast enhancement to help recover peripheral details that are resolvable by our eye but degraded by filtering. We validate our system by performing another user study. Frequency analysis shows our system closely matches our perceptual target. Measurements of temporal stability show we obtain quality similar to temporally filtered non-foveated renderings.},

  abstract = {The quest for deeper understanding of biological systems has driven the acquisition of increasingly larger multidimensional image datasets. Inspecting and manipulating data of this complexity is very challenging in traditional visualization systems. We developed syGlass, a software package capable of visualizing large scale volumetric data with inexpensive virtual reality head-mounted display technology. This allows leveraging stereoscopic vision to significantly improve perception of complex 3D structures, and provides immersive interaction with data directly in 3D. We accomplished this by developing highly optimized data flow and volume rendering pipelines, tested on datasets up to 16TB in size, as well as tools available in a virtual reality GUI to support advanced data exploration, annotation, and cataloguing.}

  abstract = {Summary: ImgLib2 is an open-source Java library for n-dimensional data representation and manipulation with focus on image processing. It aims at minimizing code duplication by cleanly separating pixel-algebra, data access and data representation in memory. Algorithms can be implemented for classes of pixel types and generic access patterns by which they become independent of the specific dimensionality, pixel type and data representation. ImgLib2 illustrates that an elegant high-level programming interface can be achieved without sacrificing performance. It provides efficient implementations of common data types, storage layouts and algorithms. It is the data model underlying ImageJ2, the KNIME Image Processing toolbox and an increasing number of Fiji-Plugins. Availability: ImgLib2 is licensed under BSD.

Using new methods for precisely controlling retinal stimulation, here we show that covert attention flexibly improves and speeds up both detection and discrimination at loci only a fraction of a degree apart within the foveola. These findings reveal a surprisingly precise control of attention and its involvement in fine spatial vision. They show that the commonly studied covert shifts of attention away from the fovea are the expression of a global mechanism that exerts its action across the entire visual field.},

  abstract = {In the early days of personal computing, a model called "Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection Rules" (GOMS) provided a method with which to quantify user interaction with a system. [2] Soon after, the Keystroke Level Model (KLM) allowed decomposition of complex tasks into atomic, benchmarked 'operators' that could generalize and estimate interactions on any keyboard interface. However, this the model is dated and unsuitable for today's modern devices. These touchscreen interfaces are now pervasive [4], but the HCI implications of this shift are not fully researched; an imperative exists for research in human-computer interaction to study these interfaces and the interactions of the people using them. [3] In this paper, we introduce new operators and other modifications to KLM-GOMS to accommodate modern touchscreen interfaces. We call these additions, together with updates to the existing KLM operators, the Touch Level Model (TLM). We propose that this model can be employed to model human task performance on a constrained-input touchscreen device and, with proper benchmarking, accurately predict actual user performance. Our goal is to provide a means for quantitative analysis of touchscreen interfaces for HCI research and to enable description of interactions with such interfaces in terms of these operators, thus predicting user performance with less need to create prototypes or perform user studies.}

However, the cellular behaviours that lead to a properly regenerated tissue are not well understood. Using a new, non-invasive, intravital two-photon imaging approach we study physiological hair-follicle regeneration over time in live mice. By these means we have monitored the behaviour of epithelial stem cells and their progeny2,3,4 during physiological hair regeneration and addressed how the mesenchyme5 influences their behaviour. Consistent with earlier studies6, stem cells are quiescent during the initial stages of hair regeneration, whereas the progeny are more actively dividing. Moreover, stem cell progeny divisions are spatially organized within follicles. In addition to cell divisions, coordinated cell movements of the progeny allow the rapid expansion of the hair follicle. Finally, we show the requirement of the mesenchyme for hair regeneration through targeted cell ablation and long-term tracking of live hair follicles. Thus, we have established an in vivo approach that has led to the direct observation of cellular mechanisms of growth regulation within the hair follicle and that has enabled us to precisely investigate functional requirements of hair-follicle components during the process of physiological regeneration.},

Here we present the AutoPilot framework, an automated method for spatiotemporally adaptive imaging that integrates (i) a multi-view light-sheet microscope capable of digitally translating and rotating light-sheet and detection planes in three dimensions and (ii) a computational method that continuously optimizes spatial resolution across the specimen volume in real time. We demonstrate long-term adaptive imaging of entire developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Drosophila melanogaster embryos and perform adaptive whole-brain functional imaging in larval zebrafish. Our method improves spatial resolution and signal strength two to five-fold, recovers cellular and sub-cellular structures in many regions that are not resolved by non-adaptive imaging, adapts to spatiotemporal dynamics of genetically encoded fluorescent markers and robustly optimizes imaging performance during large-scale morphogenetic changes in living organisms.},

It is known that visual percepts tend to fade when retinal image motion is eliminated in the laboratory5,6,7,8,9. However, it has long been debated whether, during natural viewing, fixational eye movements have functions in addition to preventing the visual scene from fading10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17. In this study, we analysed the influence in humans of fixational eye movements on the discrimination of gratings masked by noise that has a power spectrum similar to that of natural images. Using a new method of retinal image stabilization18, we selectively eliminated the motion of the retinal image that normally occurs during the intersaccadic intervals of visual fixation. Here we show that fixational eye movements improve discrimination of high spatial frequency stimuli, but not of low spatial frequency stimuli. This improvement originates from the temporal modulations introduced by fixational eye movements in the visual input to the retina, which emphasize the high spatial frequency harmonics of the stimulus. In a natural visual world dominated by low spatial frequencies, fixational eye movements appear to constitute an effective sampling strategy by which the visual system enhances the processing of spatial detail.},

  abstract = {ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used in the biological sciences and beyond. Due to its ease of use, recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture, ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of modern science. We rewrote the entire ImageJ codebase, engineering a redesigned plugin mechanism intended to facilitate extensibility at every level, with the goal of creating a more powerful tool that continues to serve the existing community while addressing a wider range of scientific requirements. This next-generation ImageJ, called ``ImageJ2'' in places where the distinction matters, provides a host of new functionality. It separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets, which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition. Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace. Scientific imaging benefits from open-source programs that advance new method development and deployment to a diverse audience. ImageJ has continuously evolved with this idea in mind; however, new and emerging scientific requirements have posed corresponding challenges for ImageJ's development. The described improvements provide a framework engineered for flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as accommodate future needs. Future efforts will focus on implementing new algorithms in this framework and expanding collaborations with other popular scientific software suites.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a ray tracing algorithm for rendering 3D scalar fields. An illumination model is developed in which the field is characterized as a varying density emittter with a single level of scattering. This model is equivalent to a particle system in which the particles are sufficiently small. Along each ray cast from the eye, the field is expressed as a function of the ray parameter. The algorithm computes properties of the field along the ray such as the attenuated intensity, the peak density, and the center of gravity, etc., These are mapped into HSV color space to produce an image for visualization.Images produced in this manner are perceived as a varying density 'cloud' where color highlights the computed attributes. The application of this technique is demonstrated for visualizing a three dimensional seismic data set.},

  abstract = {Actin and myosin assemble into a thin layer of a highly dynamic network underneath the membrane of eukaryotic cells. This network generates the forces that drive cell- and tissue-scale morphogenetic processes. The effective material properties of this active network determine large-scale deformations and other morphogenetic events. For example, the characteristic time of stress relaxation (the Maxwell time {$\tau$} M ) in the actomyosin sets the timescale of large-scale deformation of the cortex. Similarly, the characteristic length of stress propagation (the hydrodynamic length {$\lambda$}) sets the length scale of slow deformations, and a large hydrodynamic length is a prerequisite for long-ranged cortical flows. Here we introduce a method to determine physical parameters of the actomyosin cortical layer in~vivo directly from laser ablation experiments. For this we investigate the cortical response to laser ablation in the one-cell-stage Caenorhabditis elegans embryo and in the gastrulating zebrafish embryo. These responses can be interpreted using a coarse-grained physical description of the cortex in terms of a two-dimensional thin film of an active viscoelastic gel. To determine the Maxwell time {$\tau$} M , the hydrodynamic length {$\lambda$}, the ratio of active stress {$\zeta$} {$\Delta$} {$\mu$} , and per-area friction {$\gamma$}, we evaluated the response to laser ablation in two different ways: by quantifying flow and density fields as a function of space and time, and by determining the time evolution of the shape of the ablated region. Importantly, both methods provide best-fit physical parameters that are in close agreement with each other and that are similar to previous estimates in the two systems. Our method provides an accurate and robust means for measuring physical parameters of the actomyosin cortical layer. It can be useful for investigations of actomyosin mechanics at the cellular-scale, but also for providing insights into the active mechanics processes that govern tissue-scale morphogenesis.},

The reconstruction, segmentation and registration are best approached from the 3D representation of the data set. RESULTS:Here we present a platform-independent framework based on Java and Java 3D for accelerated rendering of biological images. Our framework is seamlessly integrated into ImageJ, a free image processing package with a vast collection of community-developed biological image analysis tools. Our framework enriches the ImageJ software libraries with methods that greatly reduce the complexity of developing image analysis tools in an interactive 3D visualization environment. In particular, we provide high-level access to volume rendering, volume editing, surface extraction, and image annotation. The ability to rely on a library that removes the low-level details enables concentrating software development efforts on the algorithm implementation parts. CONCLUSIONS:Our framework enables biomedical image software development to be built with 3D visualization capabilities with very little effort. We offer the source code and convenient binary packages along with extensive documentation at http://3dviewer.neurofly.de.},

The viewing direction for subjects while watching the contents were recorded in terms of the three coordinates yaw, roll and pitch. Experimental results show that HTC Vive offers better integral quality compared to Oculus Rift.

Gaze pattern comparison is essential to understanding how radiologists examine medical images, and to identifying factors influencing the examination. Most prior work depended upon comparisons with manually juxtaposed static images of gaze tracking results. Comparative gaze analysis with volumetric images is more challenging due to the additional cognitive load on 3D perception. A recent study proposed a visualization design based on direct volume rendering (DVR) for visualizing gaze patterns in volumetric images; however, effective and comprehensive gaze pattern comparison is still challenging due to a lack of interactive visualization tools for comparative gaze analysis. We take the challenge with GazeDx while integrating crucial contextual information such as pupil size and windowing into the analysis process for more in-depth and ecologically valid findings. Among the interactive visualization components in GazeDx, a context-embedded interactive scatterplot is especially designed to help users examine abstract gaze data in diverse contexts by embedding medical imaging representations well known to radiologists in it. We present the results from two case studies with two experienced radiologists, where they compared the gaze patterns of 14 radiologists reading two patients' volumetric CT images.},

We describe a non-iterative method of initialising this model from detected pupil ellipses, and two methods of iteratively optimising the parameters of the model to best fit the original eye images. We also present a novel eye image dataset~\ldots}

  abstract = {Predicting human fixations from images has recently seen large improvements by leveraging deep representations which were pretrained for object recognition. However, as we show in this paper, these networks are highly overparameterized for the task of fixation prediction. We first present a simple yet principled greedy pruning method which we call Fisher pruning. Through a combination of knowledge distillation and Fisher pruning, we obtain much more runtime-efficient architectures for saliency prediction, achieving a 10x speedup for the same AUC performance as a state of the art network on the CAT2000 dataset. Speeding up single-image gaze prediction is important for many real-world applications, but it is also a crucial step in the development of video saliency models, where the amount of data to be processed is substantially larger.},

It offers a versatile and modular solution that works out of the box for end users, through a simple and intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time, 3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants. TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an extensible platform where developers can easily write their own detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing TrackMate modules without the need of having to write de novo user interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting tools. The current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in the context of three different biological problems. First, we perform Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-{$\kappa$}B essential modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in plant cells.},

  abstract = {Occlusion is an issue in volumetric visualization as it prevents direct visualization of the region of interest. While many techniques such as transfer functions, volume segmentation or view distortion have been developed to address this, there is still room for improvement to better support the understanding of objects' vicinity. However, most existing Focus+Context fail to solve partial occlusion in datasets where the target and the occluder are very similar density-wise. For these reasons, we investigate a new technique which maintains the general structure of the investigated volumetric dataset while addressing occlusion issues. With our technique, the user interactively defines an area of interest where an occluded region or object is partially visible. Then our lens starts pushing at its border occluding objects, thus revealing hidden volumetric data. Next, the lens is modified with an extended field of view (fish-eye deformation) to better see the vicinity of the selected region. Finally, the user can freely explore the surroundings of the area under investigation within the lens. To provide real-time exploration, we implemented our lens using a GPU accelerated ray-casting framework to handle ray deformations, local lighting, and local viewpoint manipulation. We illustrate our technique with five application scenarios in baggage inspection, 3D fluid flow visualization, chest radiology, air traffic planning, and DTI fiber exploration.},

Automatic techniques often fail for large and complex datasets, and connectomics researchers may spend weeks or months manually tracing neurons using 2D image stacks. We present a design study of a new virtual reality (VR) system, developed in collaboration with trained neuroanatomists, to trace neurons in microscope scans of the visual cortex of primates. We hypothesize that using consumer-grade VR technology to interact with neurons directly in 3D will help neuroscientists better resolve complex cases and enable them to trace neurons faster and with less physical and mental strain. We discuss both the design process and technical challenges in developing an interactive system to navigate and manipulate terabyte-sized image volumes in VR. Using a number of different datasets, we demonstrate that, compared to widely used commercial software, consumer-grade VR presents a promising alternative for scientists.},

We present Pursuits, an innovative interaction technique that enables truly spontaneous interaction with eye-based interfaces.

Instead of being based on gaze location, Pursuits correlates eye pursuit movements with objects dynamically moving on the interface. We evaluate the influence of target speed, number and trajectory and develop guidelines for designing Pursuits-based interfaces. We then describe six realistic usage scenarios and implement three of them to evaluate the method in a usability study and a field study. Our results show that Pursuits is a versatile and robust technique and that users can interact with Pursuits-based interfaces without prior knowledge or preparation phase.},

Those interested in deploying these head-mounted displays need to understand better the effect technology has on the end user. One key aspect potentially hindering the use is motion sickness, a known problem inherited from virtual reality, which so far remains under-explored. In this paper we address this problem by conducting an experiment with 142 subjects in three different industries: aviation, medical, and space. We evaluate whether the Microsoft HoloLens, an augmented reality head-mounted display, causes simulator sickness and how different symptom groups contribute to it (nausea, oculomotor and disorientation). Our findings suggest that the Microsoft HoloLens causes across all participants only negligible symptoms of simulator sickness. Most consumers who use it will face no symptoms while only few experience minimal discomfort in the training environments we tested it in.}

  abstract = {Anatomical superposition of the cortical projections from the overlapping visual fields of the two eyes does not make it obvious how the disposition of objects in the third dimension is encoded. Hubel and Wiesel's demonstration that units in the primary visual cortex of the mammal respond preferentially to elongated contours of specific orientation encouraged the inquiry into whether binocular disparity might not similarly be represented as an attribute interdigitated within the orderly progression of position. When this was found to indeed be the case, this entrained a brisk research activity into the disparity of receptive fields of single units in the primary visual cortex and the influence on their response of the three-dimensional locations of outside world stimuli. That cells' preferred orientations covered the whole gamut whereas space perception required only horizontal disparity was an apparent paradox that needed resolution. A connection with an observer's stereoscopic performance was made by the discovery that cells in the primate primary visual cortex display good tuning to the disparity in random-dot stereograms. But a wide gap still remains between the properties of these cortical units and human stereo thresholds in simple target configurations, let alone depth judgments in which perceptual and cognitive factors enter. When the neural circuits in the primary visual cortex that are involved in processing depth are eventually traced in detail they will also need to have properties that allow for the plasticity in learning and experience.},

A similar approach can be applied to Atari playing. Programs are evolved using mixed type CGP with a function set suited for matrix operations, including image processing, but allowing for controller behavior to emerge. While the programs are relatively small, many controllers are competitive with state of the art methods for the Atari benchmark set and require less training time. By evaluating the programs of the best evolved individuals, simple but effective strategies can be found.}

  abstract = {In the brain, learning signals change over time and synaptic location, and are applied based on the learning history at the synapse, in the complex process of neuromodulation. Learning in artificial neural networks, on the other hand, is shaped by hyper-parameters set before learning starts, which remain static throughout learning, and which are uniform for the entire network. In this work, we propose a method of deep artificial neuromodulation which applies the concepts of biological neuromodulation to stochastic gradient descent. Evolved neuromodulatory dynamics modify learning parameters at each layer in a deep neural network over the course of the network's training. We show that the same neuromodulatory dynamics can be applied to different models and can scale to new problems not encountered during evolution. Finally, we examine the evolved neuromodulation, showing that evolution found dynamic, location-specific learning strategies.}

Detailed descriptions of cell lineages and behaviors provide a powerful framework to elucidate the mechanisms of morphogenesis. To study the cellular basis of limb development, we imaged transgenic fluorescently-labeled embryos from the crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis with multi-view light-sheet microscopy at high spatiotemporal resolution over several days of embryogenesis. The cell lineage of outgrowing thoracic limbs was reconstructed at single-cell resolution with new software called Massive Multi-view Tracker (MaMuT). In silico clonal analyses suggested that the early limb primordium becomes subdivided into anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral compartments whose boundaries intersect at the distal tip of the growing limb. Limb-bud formation is associated with spatial modulation of cell proliferation, while limb elongation is also driven by preferential orientation of cell divisions along the proximal-distal growth axis. Cellular reconstructions were predictive of the expression patterns of limb development genes including the BMP morphogen Decapentaplegic.},

We would like to obtain a compact, expressive, and interpretable representation of scenes that encodes information such as the number of objects and their categories, poses, positions, etc. Such a representation would allow us to reason about and even reconstruct or manipulate elements of the scene. Previous works have used encoder-decoder based neural architectures to learn image representations; however, representations obtained in this way are typically uninterpretable, or only explain a single object in the scene. In this work, we propose a new approach to learn an interpretable distributed representation of scenes. Our approach employs a deterministic rendering function as the decoder, mapping a naturally structured and disentangled scene description, which we named scene XML, to an image. By doing so, the encoder is forced to perform the inverse of the rendering operation (a.k.a. de-rendering) to transform an input image to the structured scene XML that the decoder used to produce the image. We use a object proposal based encoder that is trained by minimizing both the supervised prediction and the unsupervised reconstruction errors. Experiments demonstrate that our approach works well on scene de-rendering with two different graphics engines, and our learned representation can be easily adapted for a wide range of applications like image editing, inpainting, visual analogy-making, and image captioning.}

  abstract = {Analyzing social streams is important for many applications, such as crisis management. However, the considerable diversity, increasing volume, and high dynamics of social streams of large events continue to be significant challenges that must be overcome to ensure effective exploration. We propose a novel framework by which to handle complex social streams on a budget PC. This framework features two components: 1) an online method to detect important time periods (i.e., subevents), and 2) a tailored GPU-assisted Self-Organizing Map (SOM) method, which clusters the tweets of subevents stably and efficiently. Based on the framework, we present StreamExplorer to facilitate the visual analysis, tracking, and comparison of a social stream at three levels. At a macroscopic level, StreamExplorer uses a new glyph-based timeline visualization, which presents a quick multi-faceted overview of the ebb and flow of a social stream. At a mesoscopic level, a map visualization is employed to visually summarize the social stream from either a topical or geographical aspect. At a microscopic level, users can employ interactive lenses to visually examine and explore the social stream from different perspectives. Two case studies and a task-based evaluation are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of StreamExplorer.},

Here we report a property of end stopping in V1 that distinguishes among different sign-of-contrast situations, thereby obviating the need for explicit junction detectors. We show that the inhibitory effect of the end zones in end-stopped cells is highly selective for the relative sign of contrast between the central activating stimulus and stimuli presented at the end zones. Conversely, the facilitatory effect of end zones in length-summing cells is not selective for the relative sign of contrast between the central activating stimulus and stimuli presented at the end zones. This finding indicates that end stopping belongs in the category of cortical computations that are selective for sign of contrast, such as direction selectivity and disparity selectivity, but length summation does not.},

Piezoceramic benders provide the wearer of the glove with tactile feedback. These sensors are mounted on the light-weight glove and connected to the driving hardware via a small cable. Applications of the glove and its component technologies include its use in conjunction with a host computer which drives a real-time 3-dimensional model of the hand allowing the glove wearer to manipulate computer-generated objects as if they were real, interpretation of finger-spelling, evaluation of hand impairment in addition to providing an interface to a visual programming language.},
