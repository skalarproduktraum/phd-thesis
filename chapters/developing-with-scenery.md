# Developing with _scenery_



In this chapter, we describe how to develop prototypes and applications with scenery. For that we're first going to introduce the principles of _Iterative Design_.

With scenery, we aim to give both developers and users a tool which can help them design new visualisations for their biological data with ease. While creating scenery took now the better part of two years, creating a new visualisation, demo, or entire application with it is usually a matter of minutes for the first prototype.

## Define, Make, Learn — Principles of Iterative Design

In [@Jerald:2015vk], Jerald argues that Iterative Design is the ideal paradigm for designing Virtual Reality applications, as — opposed to regular user interface design — there are no "golden rules" (yet), and a lot has to be discovered throughout the design process. He also argues for "accidental discoveries" during the design process, discoveries that would not happen if Iterative Design would not have been applied.

Following Jerald, we can define three distinct phases in the Iterative Design process:

1. _Define_ — The planning phase, includes everything from "what are we actually trying to achieve?", to a list of requirements for the final visualisation/demo/application.
2. _Make_ — In this phase, we're trying to answer the question of "how are we going to do that?", and bring the result into practise.
3. _Learn_ — In the final phase, we're analysing what works and what doesn't, feeding that information back into the _Define_ stage, continuing with the cycle.
