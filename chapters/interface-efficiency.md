# Interface Efficiency

The efficiency of Human-Computer Interfaces can be measured in various ways, e.g. by watching different types of users — unexperienced vs. experienced — use a specific interface and evaluating their actions subjectively, or by trying to come up with a mathematical model of how the user will interact a specific interface. 

## The GOMS Model for Quantifying Interface Efficiency

A widely used model for quantification the efficiency of an interface is a model based on defining (_G_)oals, a set of (_O_)perators used as instruments, a set of (_M_)ethods to achieve the defined Goals, and a definition of (_S_)election rules how to discern competing methods, in short _GOMS_. The GOMS model, or it's original version, the _Keystroke-Level Model_ (KLM) was introduced in 1980 by Card, Moran, and Newell [@Card:1980kl] and can help to predict the time taken by an experienced user to perform a given task.

The GOMS model has the benefit that it is quite simple and easy to evaluate, and — despite making average assumptions about the time taken for different parts of the task's execution — it is also quite accurate, and since its inception has been widely used (see e.g. \TODO{add example papers} for examples). Its downsides are that it does not take other aspects of the user's performance into consideration, such as fatigue, learning, or errors made during execution [@Card:1980kl].

Since the development of the original model, more derivatives of it came up, such as _CPM-GOMS_ [@John:1995cp], which extends the original GOMS model to parallel tasks, or the _Touch-Level Model_ (TLM), which extends GOMS to touch-enabled devices which are nowadays ubiquitous [@Rice:2014341].
