# Introduction

## The State of Biology

In recent years, biology has made a remarkable jump from being a discipline that is entirely wetlab-based to a a discipline utilising the tools and methods of mathematics, physics and computer science. Developments on the experimental side like light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (cite), optogenetics (cite) or Cryo-EM (cite) have opened new venues for investigation, while theoretical contributions like active matter theory (cite) or ... now shed more light on these results.

Investigating biological systems in two dimensions have already led to remarkable results in the past (Drosophila embryonic genes, etc.). Building on these, and utilising the techniques mentioned above, we are now able to investigate biological systems in three dimensions, and over time, making correct reasoning about spatiotemporal processes a reality. 

Even more recent developments, like CRISPR/Cas9 (cite) or gene drives enable us to manipulate specimen in ways and on timescales thought impossible before. 

All of these need new, flexible ways of interacting with the data produced, and with the instruments producing this data.

## Virtual and Augmented Reality

With the advent of the first small-enough computers, and small-enough cathode-ray tubes (CRTs), the development of devices that give the user the ability to inhabit a virtual environment or use more than just a keyboard for input of data started. Early examples of such systems are The Sword of Damocles (cite) or the Sketchpad system (cite) from the 1960s. In the meantime, and over the course of two Virtual Reality Revolutions -- with important developments like the CAVE (CAVE Automatic Virtual Environment, cite) --  head-mounted displays (HMDs) have now become a commodity and can be bought for about 400$, bringing a once highly expensive, specialised device into the homes of users.

## Natural User Interfaces

Complimentary to these display devices, new input methods are also on the rise, such as free-air gesture input (e.g. the widely available Microsoft Kinect), touch input (multitouch screens in nearly every contemporary mobile phone) or even devices controlled by the gaze of the user (Tobii, cite). Such devices and their interaction modalities are commonly called Natural User Interfaces (NUIs, cite).

## Scope of this thesis

In this thesis, we develop a framework that enables rapid prototyping of visualisations of biology data, and interaction with such data on the basis of Natural User Interfaces. We will demonstrate the utility and comprehensiveness of the framework on a set of case studies.
