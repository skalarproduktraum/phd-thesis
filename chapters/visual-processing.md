# Visual Processing

## A Short Tour of the Human Visual System

Visual processing of photons received by the eye's lens, cornea, and ultimately, retina is the basic process enabling cross reality and eye-based natural user interfaces. In this chapter, we will give a short tour of the human visual system, including the optical path of photons, and the processing that happens in the retina and downstream in the central nervous system.

On an abstract level, the processing of visual stimuli happens in multiple stages (with the human eye depicted in figure\ref{fig:eye_diagram}):

1. Accumulation of incoming photons by the optical system consisting of the _cornea_ (8), _iris_(9), and _lens_(11) onto the _retina_(30), and especially the most sensitive part of the retina, the _fovea_(26).
2. Pre-processing in the _Lateral Geniculate Nucleus_ (LGN) situated in the _thalamus_ part of the forebrain, serving as a relay for the information coming directly from the retina. Fascinatingly, the left LGN processes information from the right eye, and vice versa -- a pattern common in the human brain.
3. Final processing in the _visual cortex_ of the occipital lobe on the back of the brain.

## Optical Path

Light enters the anterior chamber (7) of the eye, and travels through the iris (9), acting as an aperture, to the lens (11). Evolution has optimised the refractive index of the human cornea to yield an optimal air/cornea boundary, rendering the final image sharp on the retina. The lens, held in place by the ciliary body (3), and the zonules of Zinn, focuses the incident light onto the retina, and especially on the most sensitive part of the retina, the fovea(26).
