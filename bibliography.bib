annote = {The tissues of a developing embryo are simultaneously patterned, moved and differentiated according to an exchange of information between their constituent cells. We argue that these complex self-organizing phenomena can only be fully understood with quantitative mathematical frameworks that allow specific hypotheses to be formulated and tested. The quantitative and dynamic imaging of growing embryos at the molecular, cellular and tissue level is the key experimental advance required to achieve this interaction between theory and experiment. Here we describe how mathematical modelling has become an invaluable method to integrate quantitative biological information across temporal and spatial scales, serving to connect the activity of regulatory molecules with the morphological development of organisms.}

year = {2002},

annote = {The volumetric data set is important in many scientific and biomedical fields. Since such sets may be extremely large, a compression method is critical to store and transmit them. To achieve a high compression rate, most of the existing volume compression methods are lossy, which is usually unacceptable in biomedical applications. We developed a new context-based non-linear prediction method to preprocess the volume data set in order to effectively lower the prediction entropy. The prediction error is further encoded using Huffman code. Unlike the conventional methods, the volume is divided into cubical blocks to take advantage of the data's spatial locality. Instead of building one Huffman tree for each block, we developed a novel binning algorithm that build a Huffman tree for each group (bin) of blocks. Combining all the effects above, we achieved an excellent compression rate compared to other lossless volume compression methods. In addition, an auxiliary data structure, Scalable Hyperspace File (SHSF) is used to index the huge volume so that we can obtain many other benefits including parallel construction, on-the-fly accessing of compressed data without global decompression, fast previewing, efficient background compressing, and scalability etc.}

annote = {his paper introduces a representation scheme for image sequences using nonuniform samples embedded in a deformable mesh structure. It describes a sequence by nodal positions and colors in a starting frame, followed by nodal displacements in the following frames. The nodal points in the mesh are more densely distributed in regions containing interesting features such as edges and corners; and are dynamically updated to follow the same features in successive frames. They are determined automatically by maximizing feature (e.g, gradient) magnitudes at nodal points, while minimizing interpolation errors within individual elements, and matching errors between corresponding elements. In order to avoid the mesh elements becoming overly deformed, a penalty term is also incorporated, which measures the irregularity of the mesh structure. The notions of shape functions and master elements commonly used in the finite element method have been applied to simplify the numerical calculation of the energy functions and their gradients. The proposed representation is motivated by the active contour or snake model proposed by Kass, Witkin, and Terzopoulos. The current representation retains the salient merit of the original model as a feature tracker based on local and collective information, while facilitating more accurate image interpolation and prediction. Our computer simulations have shown that the proposed scheme can successfully track facial feature movements in head-and-shoulder type of sequences, and more generally, interframe changes that can be modeled as elastic deformation. Ideas from FEM --->The treatment for the starting frame also constitutes an efficient representation of arbitrary still images. <--- TRacking of features through time}

annote = {Multiresolution triangulation meshes are widely used in computer graphics for 3-d modeling of shapes. We propose an image representation and processing framework using a multiscale triangulation of the grayscale function. Triangles have the potential of approximating edges better than the blocky structures of tensorproduct wavelets. Among the many possible triangulation schemes, normal meshes are natural for efficiently representing singularities in image data thanks to their adaptivi@ to the smoothness of the modeled image. Our non-linear, multiscale image decomposition algorithm, based on this subdivision scheme, takes edges into account in a way that is closely related to wedgelets and curvelets. The highly adaptive property of the normal mesh construction provides a very efficient representation of images, which potentially outperforms standard wavelet transforms. We demonstrate the approximation performance of the normal mesh representation through mathematical analyses for simple functions and simulations for real images.}

In animal studies the anatomic distortions may be caused by brain ex- traction and chemical tissue clearing, which are performed prior to scanning and allows the light sheet to penetrate with minimal scat- tering and absorption [2]. The tissue clearing procedure also intro- duces unwanted intensity distortions since the efficiency varies be- tween subjects. The optical elements inside the LSFM system also causes intensity distortions which may appear differently across sub- jects but generally appear as slowly varying spatial inhomogeneities of the intensities. These distortions pose a challenge to image segmentation meth- ods. The most common form of LSFM-related segmentation con- cerns the identification of highly local intensity build ups [3], used to investigate cellular morphologies within anatomical regions of in- terest.}

Fourth, high accuracy and robustness are required, because a few errors can fundamentally alter lineage results. In general, computational approaches to cell segmentation and tracking can be divided into three main categories: contour evolu- tion (for example, level sets)21, state-space models (for example, particle filters)22 and data association methods (for example, graph matching)20,23. All of these approaches have individual strengths and weaknesses, and none solves all of the challenges outlined above. For example, contour evolution methods can be slow to compute for thousands of three-dimensional (3D) objects, but they provide detailed cell outlines, even during cell division. State-space models and data association methods do not scale well with increasing object density. However, they can model complex spatiotemporal knowledge about the system. Here we present a new hybrid approach to segmenting and tracking cell nuclei, which facilitates fast and accurate recon- struction of cell lineages. Our method operates on three princi- ples. First, we reduce data size and complexity by using low-level segmentation to generate supervoxels. Second, we use paramet- ric contour evolution, which p}

annote = {``Adaptation to mean light level ensures that our visual responses are matched to the average signal in real time, thus maintaining sensitivity to the fluctuations around this mean. But the fluctuations themselves are intermittent, such that periods of large fluctuations are interspersed with periods of relative ``quiet.'' Recent ob- servations indicate that the intermittency of natural sig- nals is of a special form: statistics such as the variance and correlation function are stationary over some re- gions, with slowly modulated parameters over larger regions (Ruderman and Bialek, 1994; Nelken et al., 1999). The principle of efficient coding suggests that the ner- vous system should adapt its strategy to these local statistical properties of the stimulus. Evidence for such statistical adaptation in the early stages of vision has been found in the fly (van Hateren, 1997) and in the vertebrate retina (Smirnakis et al., 1997), where mecha- nisms of gain control are well known (Shapley and Victor, 1979a, 1979b, 1980).'' Previous work has shown that this system adapts to constant velocity signals (Maddess and Laugh- lin, 1985; de Ruyter van Steveninck et al., 1986), to the variance of spatial image contrast (de Ruyter van Ste- veninck et al., 1996), We find a dramatic adaptive rescaling of the system's input/output relation with the standard deviation of the signal distribution. Further, we find that the magnitude of the rescaling selected by the adaptation process opti- mizes information transmission.}

However, this freedom would create another techni-cal challenge and bottleneck: the large size of the acquired data. Modern light-sheet techniques generate an enormous volume of images (many terabytes per day) that need to be transferred, stored and analyzed, putting pressure on the limits of even state-of-the-art infrastructures. Big image data have limited most experiments to a single sample and pre- vented systematic analysis of large ensembles. Although dedicated hardware and software might alleviate the problem9, treating acquisi- tion and processing as mutually independent is no longer a viable solution. By acquiring blindly and processing later, we obtain image data that are vastly larger than the specific information sought from the sample (e.g., dynamic tracks of cell movements and average fluorescent level per cell). Instead, we need a flexible, smart acquisition concept that deliv- ers information-rich data with minimal over- head. As an intrinsic benefit the sample would be less exposed through more discriminatory data acquisition. Achieving this will require feedback between imaging and data process- ing to record only what is necessary. Ideally this should happen right at the source---in the microscope, at the camera. Real Time: Intelligent feedback between control, acqui- sition and processing is a basic requirement of such an approach. It provides the flexibility to optimally use all available resources and to get the most information from each experiment within our time constraints. Closed-loop feedbacks have proven useful for imaging in research and in industry for different pur- poses including autofocus, automation of screening experiments10 or quality control. Adaptive optics yielded impressive improve- ments in image quality in astronomy and more recently in biology11, particularly for deep tissue imaging. However, for systematic in vivo microscopy it is not insufficient qual- ity, but the sheer amount of image data, that poses the primary challenge. of adaptive acquisition has to be extended to selectively collect only data of interest in the first place, tailored to the particular question at hand.}

Triangular Mesh: This work presents a novel method based on Binary Space Partitions in combination with three clustering schemes to approximate an image with a mesh If a triangle's equation does not have the ability to reconstruct the pixels lying within up to a predefined error, it is split into two new triangles. Tested on several real images, the proposed method leads to reduced size meshes in a fast manner while retaining the visual quality of the reconstructed images. In addition, it is parallelizable due to the property of Binary Space Partitions which facilitates its application in real-time scenarios. The main idea behind this work is that each triangle of the mesh can be uniquely described with the plane defined by its three vertices. In this way, a triangle of the mesh is ob- tained while its nodes are the sought nonuniform samples. If any of the obtained triangles, cannot represent the points that lie within up to a predefined error metric, it is further split into two smaller triangles until the error is satisfied across the image. Three versions of the meshing scheme are derived based on the methodology used to split each triangle. The first one is based on the tritree concept which equally divides each triangle into two smaller ones. The second is based on the kmeans clustering technique which splits a triangle by finding the centers of the two main clusters of the pixels [24].}

Raw data could even be deleted after processing, since it may be cheaper to repeat the experiment than to store the massive amount of raw data. However, most biologists are likely to be reluctant to follow this strategy; who would want to delete spectacular recordings and blindly trust processing pipelines that are far from per- fect? There may also be legal considerations: in Germany, for example, raw data must be kept for 10 years by law. It is time to think about what exactly ``raw data'' means in the context of light-sheet microscopy. The most promising approach for tam- ing the data deluge is to employ clever compression strategies. One can reduce the dimensionality of the data on the fly---for example, by transforming 3D stacks to 2D cartographic projections8---although such solutions typically cannot be easily gener-alized. Existing compression algorithms, although able to reduce raw data volumes impressively, come with a cost in regard to interactive access to the data. An ideal scheme would be fast and reduce the data to a fraction of its original volume using the temporal dimension. Although such com- pression schemes are under intense research in computer science labs, biologists have to get seriously geeky to be able to handle light- sheet microscopy data sets. Information technology (IT) is barely on the curriculum of most biology departments, and yet in the absence of professional IT support, which is often lacking, the burden will fall on biolo- gists. Fortunately, IT companies, such as Acquifer, see a business opportunity in help- ing biologists shuffle their piles of light-sheet imagery.}

Our algorithm uses hi- erarchical simplification to efficiently induce a parameterization of the original mesh over a base domain consisting of a small num- ber of triangles. This initial parameterization is further improved through a hierarchical smoothing procedure based on Loop sub- division applied in the parameter domain. Our method supports both fully automatic and user constrained operations. In the lat- ter, we accommodate point and edge constraints to force the align-ment of iso-parameter lines with desired features. We show how to use the parameterization for fast, hierarchical subdivision con- nectivity remeshing with guaranteed error bounds. The remeshing algorithm constructs an adaptively subdivided mesh directly with- out first resorting to uniform subdivision followed by subsequent sparsification. It thus avoids the exponential cost of the latter. Our parameterizations are also useful for texture mapping and morphing applications, among others. We describe an O(N log N ) time and storage algorithm to con- struct a logarithmic level hierarchy of arbitrary topology, ir- regular connectivity meshes based on the Dobkin-Kirkpatrick (DK) algorithm. Our algorithm accommodates geometric crite- ria such as area and curvature as well as vertex and edge con- straints. * We construct a smooth parameterization of the original mesh over the base domain. This parameterization is derived through repeated conformal remapping during graph simplification fol- lowed by a parameter space smoothing procedure based on the Loop scheme. The resulting parameterizations are of high visual and numerical quality. * Using the smooth parameterization, we describe an algorithm for adaptive, hierarchical remeshing of arbitrary meshes into subdivision connectivity meshes. The procedure is fully auto- matic, but also allows for user intervention in the form of fixing point or path features in the original mesh. The remeshed man- ifold meets conservative approximation bounds.}

Deconvolution reduces blurring from out-of-focus light to improve the contrast and sharpness of image, but commercial deconvolution software is slow and expensive which cannot meet the current demand. GPU is the new many-core processor with powerful floating point performance, so we parallelized the Richardson Lucy Deconvolution on the GPU.

For an image of size 1024 {\texttimes} 1024 {\texttimes} 25, the deconvolved time of 50 iterations on the GPU is no more than 2 s.}

A new inequality in multivariate normal decision theory which we call the oracle inequality shows that attained performance differs from ideal performance by at most a factor of approximately 2 log n, where n is the sample size. Moreover no estimator can give a better guarantee than this. Within the class of spatially adaptive procedures, RiskShrink is essentially optimal. Relying only on the data, it comes within a factor log2 n of the performance of piecewise polynomial and variable- knot spline methods equipped with an oracle. In contrast, it is unknown how or if piecewise polynomial methods could be made to function this well when denied access to an oracle and forced to rely on data alone.}

To render any virtual slice, only a small fraction of the image data is relevant and gets loaded into memory. The navigation is further accelerated by caching recently visited locations in memory. If images are available at multiple scales, only the most relevant scales for display are requested. This avoids aliasing artifacts at zoomed- out views and facilitates interactive browsing: low-resolution data are loaded rapidly, providing immediate feedback, whereas high- resolution detail is filled in subsequently (Supplementary Note 2). For large time series, we developed a custom open-source data format that is optimized for fast random data access at various scales (Supplementary Note 3). Each image is stored as a chunked multidimensional array at successively reduced resolutions. We build on HDF5 as an established portable data format that pro- vides efficient input and output, supports unlimited file sizes and has built-in and extensible compression facilities. Metadata, such as SPIM view registrations, are stored as XML. The proposed format integrates seamlessly with Fiji's plug-ins for SPIM image process- ing, allowing control and visualization of the intermediate steps of the pipeline (Fig. 1b--e and Supplementary Video 2). We provide Fiji plug-ins for reading and writing the format so that any image that opens in Fiji can be stored as HDF5 and viewed with the BDV plug-in (Supplementary Note 4). The virtualized access is a powerful way to present remote and/ or extremely large data sets for computation as well as visualization. In Fiji, we use our framework to make raw images of the data sets available as virtual stacks and then run standard image processing tools on arbitrarily large images. For example, a SPIM time-lapse image series may be registered, fused and deconvolved without being locally stored on the processing computer. Moreover, it is straightforward to programmatically access the pixel data using standard ImgLib2 interfaces, which means that existing code for filtering and segmentation will work without modification (Fig. 1j).}

annote = {t. Fluorescence microscopy images usually show severe aniso- tropy in axial versus lateral resolution. This hampers downstream pro- cessing, i.e. the automatic extraction of quantitative biological data. While deconvolution methods and other techniques to address this prob- lem exist, they are either time consuming to apply or limited in their ability to remove anisotropy. We propose a method to recover isotropic resolution from readily acquired anisotropic data. We achieve this us- ing a convolutional neural network that is trained end-to-end from the same anisotropic body of data we later apply the network to. The net- work effectively learns to restore the full isotropic resolution by restoring the image under a trained, sample specific image prior. We apply our method to 3 synthetic and 3 real datasets and show that our results im- prove on results from deconvolution and state-of-the-art superresolution techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that a standard 3D segmentation pipeline performs on the output of our network with comparable accu- racy as on the full isotropic data.}

Increasing the image acquisition speed further requires a corresponding increase in processing power. It remains to be seen how multiview data sets for more complex specimens such as older fruit fly embryos or the much larger zebrafish can be analyzed to a meaningful extent in a reasonable amount of time. Optimally, the microscope should deliver application-specific, meaningful information such as cell tracks and genealogy in real time rather than raw image data.}

They performed the slower segmentation and tracking task for the rapid early fly morphogenesis in a postprocessing step.}

They provide a noninvasive and nondestructive way of imaging processes in live specimens. The technique of fluorescence microscopy is one of the main applications of microscopy in biological and medical research. The sample can be fluorescently labelled with a variety of dyes that specifically bind to organelles, compartments of the cell or single proteins. Nowadays, the family of green fluorescent proteins (GFP) with its spectral variants are routinely applied to study gene and protein expression and to track single molecules in whole animals and single cells in vivo. The focus of this work is mainly on fluorescence microscopy.}
