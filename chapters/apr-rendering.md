# Rendering the Adaptive Particle Representation

## Introduction

The Adaptive Particle Representation[@Cheeseman:ia] (APR) is a representation of image data that does not rely on regular sampling as found in pixel images, but instead uses computational particles to represent point intensities and further properties in space-filling data structure similar to an octree. Especially in the context of fluorescence microscopy, this alternative representation allows for highly efficient data storage and processing, resulting in space savings of a factor of 10 to 100 compared to the original image size.
