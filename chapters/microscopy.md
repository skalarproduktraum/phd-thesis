# Fluorescence Microscopy

Fluorescence microscopy is one of the major workhorses of cell, developmental and systems biology. In the most basic version, a fluorescent molecule -- which after receiving photons of a certain, molecule-specific excitation wavelength, emits secondary photons, of longer wavelength -- is introduced into a biological specimen, e.g. as a staining, antibody, or protein intrinsically produced by the specimen after genetic modification.

## Confocal Microscopy

The confocal microscope was developed in the 1960s by Marvin Minsky, one of the pioneers of Artificial Intelligence (AI), in order to investigate neural connections in the central nervous system of mammals, and draw conclusions for AI from that. The confocal microscope enables optical sectioning by illuminating the sample sample with a coherent light source, nowadays lasers, and rejecting the emitted fluorescence with a pinhole. With this principle, it is possible to scan the specimen point-wise in X and Y directions, and provide optical sectioning by also moving it in the Z direction. Occurring fluorescence that was not rejected as background by the pinhole gets collected point-wise by a photomultiplier, and an image or volume reconstructed from that. The principle of operation is also pictured in \ref{fig:confocal_principle}.
